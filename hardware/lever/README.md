# Lever assembly
The STLs in this folder all comprise the lever assembly. These are taken from [toxicmango's design](https://github.com/toxikmango/Ongeki-Lever) but have been modified to fit cheaper parts. Once again, the parts for the lever are:
- 2x [608 skateboard bearings](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R7PR72H) (8mm ID, 22mm OD, 7mm thick) 
- [Dielectric grease](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AL2RI2) or other equivalent lubrication 
- 5/16" fully threaded bolt for the handle (5.5-6" long) 
- 5/16" fully threaded for the pivot rod (about 3.75"-4" long) 
- 5/16" nylock nuts (4)
- m3 bolts and nuts to attach the top and bottom clamp together. (35mm long) 
- m3 bolts can be used to attach the assembly to the controller body or #6 screws countersunk from the top of the controller going down into the lever assembly mounting holes. (Length depends on your wood thickness but I used 3/4" long screws.)

## Printing
Because this design is 3D printed, beware of some unwanted wiggle in your lever assembly. See this video to see what I'm talking about:

Thanks to Diz on the Cons&Stuff discord for the demonstration. Currently, I am in the process of printing this, so I will see if I can fix the tolerance issue. I believe it is related to the design of the gear.
