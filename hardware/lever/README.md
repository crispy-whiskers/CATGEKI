# Lever mechanism
The STLs in this folder all comprise the lever assembly. These are taken from [toxicmango's design](https://github.com/toxikmango/Ongeki-Lever) but have been modified to fit cheaper parts. Once again, the parts for the lever are:
- 2x [608 skateboard bearings](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R7PR72H) (8mm ID, 22mm OD, 7mm thick) 
- [Dielectric grease](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AL2RI2) or other equivalent lubrication 
- 1x 5/16" fully threaded bolt (5.5-6" long) 
- 1x 5/16" fully threaded bolt (about 3.75"-4" long) 
- 4x 5/16" nylock nuts
- 4x m3 bolts and nuts (35mm long) 
- 4+x m3 bolts/#6 screws (3/4'')

## Printing
Because this design is 3D printed, beware of some unwanted wiggle in your lever assembly. See this video to see what I'm talking about:

Thanks to Diz on the Cons&Stuff discord for the demonstration. Adjust your 3D print accordingly to the printer you are using. Check out the original repo linked above to find the test prints to make sure your settings are right. 
- I made the mistake of not doing doing the test prints. The bolt holes in the top and bottom clamp were too small for the M3 bolts and the male connector for the top clamp did not fit. Probably going to 

Your parts, once printed, should look like this.

Before moving on to assembly, make sure to properly remove supports and sand/file them down if you can't remove all of them. Press fits are what hold this mechanism together. Use glue if they don't press fit and hold. 


1. Put the skateboard bearings accordingly on the base. Insert the top clamp as shown. This requires a press fit or glue.

2. Put a 5/16'' hex nut into the lever piece and put the long hex bolt head first into the hole on top. The hex bolt may have trouble fitting in, so sand the hole if necessary and use a mallet to make sure it reaches the bottom.
