# DoneGEKI
Finally, a (soon to be) completed, documented guide for an O.N.G.E.K.I. controller.

I started this project because I had the wonderful opportunity to play on an ONGEKI machine and I immediately fell in love. I immediately started looking up DIY guides to make a controller... However, much to my dismay, literally NONE of the guides were finished, fully documented, or even guides. I went on a wild goose chase to acquire the files and knowledge I've provided here. I'm tired of poorly written, terribly documented, unfinished guides that explain nothing. This guide will make sure that doesn't happen again.

As you may notice, I'm still building this controller, so I haven't solved all the problems. I will fill it out as I go. You bet your ass I will document everything.

# Requirements
- Access to a 3D printer
- Access to basic workshop tools
- A PC with Arduino installed (google it)
- Internet access (to download what you need)

# Parts List
## Lever parts (from [toxicmango's design](https://github.com/toxikmango/Ongeki-Lever))  
### A note: I'm using a modified version of this design in order to fit cheaper parts.
- 5/16" fully threaded bolt for the handle (5.5-6" long) 
- 5/16" fully threaded for the pivot rod (about 3.75"-4" long) 
- 5/16" nylock nuts (4) 
- [608 skateboard bearings](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R7PR72H) (2 of them) (8mm ID, 22mm OD, 7mm thick) 
- m3 bolts and nuts to attach the top and bottom clamp together. (35mm long) 
- m3 bolts can be used to attach the assembly to the controller body or #6 screws countersunk from the top of the controller going down into the lever assembly mounting holes. (Length depends on your wood thickness but I used 3/4" long screws.) 
- Dielectric grease 

## Controller electronics parts

- 4x [ISTMALL 60mm Square Buttons](https://istmall.co.kr/us/goods/goods_view.php?goodsNo=1009992342)
    - Main gameplay buttons. It's worth putting money here.
    - For other options, see the [cons wiki](https://rhythm-cons.wiki/w/Buttons)
- 2x [30mm Buttons](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07WQSMY8B)
    - Start buttons. Official cab uses 30mm square buttons, no LED. You are crazy if you are sinking money into these.
    - Any button will do, really. 
- 1x [Potentiometer](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00MCK7JMS)
    - These only really come in bulk. Consider splitting the cost and ordering with other people.
